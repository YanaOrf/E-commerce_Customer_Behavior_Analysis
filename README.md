# EDA Results Report – E-Commerce Customer Data

Data set is available via link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/e-commerce-customer-behavior-dataset]

## Key Areas to Investigate

### 1. Customer Segmentation & Profiles
	•	Which groups of customers spend the most? (by Age, Gender, City, Membership Type)
	•	Do certain membership types lead to higher spend or purchase frequency?
	•	Are younger vs. older customers different in terms of satisfaction and loyalty?

### 2. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
	•	Which features (membership, discount usage, rating) are linked to higher long-term spend?
	•	Do frequent discounts reduce or increase CLV?

### 3. Shopping Behavior
	•	Correlation between Total Spend and Items Purchased (big baskets vs. high-value items).
	•	Impact of discounts on spend (are discount-heavy customers actually valuable?).
	•	Relationship between Days Since Last Purchase and likelihood of churn.

### 4. Satisfaction & Ratings
	•	Do satisfaction levels differ across membership tiers or cities?
	•	Does Average Rating predict higher spend or repeat purchases?
	•	Are dissatisfied customers more price-sensitive (use discounts more)?

### 5. Churn Analysis
	•	Customers with high Days Since Last Purchase: what patterns do they share (e.g., low satisfaction, low spend, certain cities)?
	•	Can we predict who is likely to churn?

### 6. Marketing & Retention Opportunities
	•	Identify high-value segments to target with loyalty perks.
	•	Find low-satisfaction but high-spend customers → critical to retain.
	•	Compare customers who use discounts often vs. rarely to optimize pricing strategy.
